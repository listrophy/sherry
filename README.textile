h1. Sherry?

The proper response to this is always "Rather." Therefore, this gem, when loaded, attaches the method @sherry?@ and @alfred?@ to all objects. @sherry?@ will always return the string "Rather."  @alfred?@ will always return the string "Yes, m'lord?"

h2. Install

bc. gem install sherry

or in your Gemfile:

bc. gem 'sherry'

h2. Usage

bc. irb> require 'sherry'
=> true

bc. irb> Object.sherry?
=> "Rather."

bc. irb> Object.alfred?
=> "Yes, m'lord?"
